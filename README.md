## Extract Data From Waymo Opendataset
This program is a slight modification of the tutorial
provided here https://github.com/waymo-research/waymo-open-dataset/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb


Given a folder name containing the segments with .tfrecord extension, a folder with
the sameName_extract will be created with two txt files containing general spec info and 2D box coordinates.

Then, in the same folder, all the corresponding images will be extracted and saved in jpg format.

A work in progress atm.
